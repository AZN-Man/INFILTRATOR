# THE-NHAINHAI-BORDER
So I had this game idea and decided to name it THE NHAINHAI (pronounced nai-nai) BORDER since it's about crossing a border and stuff

Basically: 

Rhochea (pronounced rou-chi-uh) is at war with Caorea (pronounced chow-ri-uh), in what was known as the Cao-Rhochean War. You can play as many different characters, such as the Journalist, the Inspector, the Agent and the Guard.

The Journalist is a (well you guessed it) journalist from Rhochea and is sent to Nhainhai, the closest Cao city to Rhochea, to report on not only the conditions in Caorea for propaganda purposes but to also collect data about the Cao people. She must attempt to cross the Nhainhai Border by lying to the Inspector and not alerting the Guard. The Agent will help eliminate the Guard and smoothen out any screwups done by the Journalist.

The Inspector is a Cao border inspector from the capital of Nimakuo, who takes up a job at the heavily fortified Nhainhai Border. He checks the passport and can be lied to by fake passports. However, the Inspector can also detect fake passports but will be bribed by the Journalist. Whether he accepts the bribe or not is up to the player. Due to the Inspector's politeness, he can be distracted by the Journalist.

The Guard is a Cao country bumpkin who is pressured by his family to become a guard at the Nhainhai Border, where no Rhocheans may cross. The reason that there is only one guard is because no one has the guts to be one, considering how unfair the pay is. He is the one who will cause the endings, as his rifle will either injure the Journalist or miss her, in case she performs any misdoing.

The Agent is a Rhochean spy who aids the Journalist in the process of trying to cross the Nhainhai Border. The Agent will also eliminate the Guard if he tries to shoot the Journalist. Not much is known about him.

The choices you make throughout the game will unlock traits, which if applied, will change the events of the game. You will achieve endings and the hardest ending is where the Journalist actually crosses the Nhainhai Border.
Dialogue between the Inspector and Guard will be in a romanised version of the Cao language.
