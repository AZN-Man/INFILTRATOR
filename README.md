# THE-RIKANDO-BORDER
Basically:

You are an American spy sent to Beijing (in the events of World War 3) to collect confidential information about the Chinese government, which is crucial for the American war effort. However, you are caught by Chinese soldiers and beaten into submission, soon getting interrogated and facing what is known as the Beijing Trials, with several other spies and American journalists.
