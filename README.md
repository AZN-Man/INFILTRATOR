# THE-RIKANDO-BORDER
So I had this game idea and decided to name it THE RIKANDO BORDER since it's about crossing a border and stuff

Basically: 

After a terrible famine strikes Tsuna, the population increasingly becomes more politically divided and aggressive to each other, to the point of terrorist attacks. Civil unrest unfolds and soon, the eastern parts of Tsuna violently breaks away from the original Tsuna after a coup in Eastern Tsuna takes place, pursuing more communist policies other than the original Tsuna's conservative ones. The continuing unrest devolves into a civil war and it cost countless lives. The Tsunese Civil War would end when the world council drew a line, seperating Tsuna into West Tsuna and East Tsuna. As the Tsunese Civil War comes to an end, the Tsunese on both sides are yet to recover from the conflict and continue being hostile to each other in a cold war-style rivalry. The year is 1975. The West Tsunese government sends espionage to the Rikando Border, as Rikando is the closest East Tsunese city to West Tsuna. You can play as many different characters, such as the Journalist, the Inspector, the Agent and the Guard.

The Journalist is a (well you guessed it) journalist from West Tsuna and is sent to Rikando, the closest East Tsunese city to West Tsuna, to report on not only the conditions in East Tsuna for propaganda purposes but to also collect data about the East Tsunese people. She must attempt to cross the Rikando Border by lying to the Inspector and not alerting the Guard. The Agent will help eliminate the Guard and smoothen out any screwups done by the Journalist.

The Inspector is an East Tsunese border inspector from the capital of Shinjito, who takes up a job at the heavily fortified Rikando Border. He checks the passport and can be lied to by fake passports. However, the Inspector can also detect fake passports but will be bribed by the Journalist. Whether he accepts the bribe or not is up to the player. Due to the Inspector's politeness, he can be distracted by the Journalist.

The Guard is an East Tsunese country bumpkin who is pressured by his family to become a guard at the Rikando Border, where no Rhocheans may cross. The reason that there is only one guard is because no one has the guts to be one, considering how unfair the pay is. He is the one who will cause the endings, as his rifle will either injure the Journalist or miss her, in case she performs any misdoing.

The Agent is a West Tsunese spy who aids the Journalist in the process of trying to cross the Rikando Border. The Agent will also eliminate the Guard if he tries to shoot the Journalist. Not much is known about him.

The choices you make throughout the game will unlock traits, which if applied, will change the events of the game. You will achieve endings and the hardest ending is where the Journalist actually crosses the Rikando Border.
