# INFILTRATOR
So, I have this game idea.

The Chinese Civil War instead results in a stalemate and as a desicion by the United Nations, China is split in half between the communist-ruled North China (PRC) and the Kuomintang-ruled South China (ROC). The border is lined to the Yangtze River, and is one of the most fortified borders ever. The game takes place in 1958, 9 years after the end of the civil war.

You are Tsu, a North Chinese spy ordered by Chairman Mao to cross the Shanghai border, in order to go to South Shanghai, and assassinate Chiang Kai-shek. He holds a speech at one of South Shanghai's official government office and you must be able to kill him on time, while sacrificing your life and getting apprehended as soon as you assassinate Chiang Kai-shek. A Second Chinese Civil War starts because of you.
